I started making this game around Halloween time so I wanted it to be Halloween themed. My friends were playing the ghost duet song in class so I decided to make my character a panda ghost. I added good and evil candies for the panda ghost to either collect or destroy. This made my game a little more challenging and added to the theme of Halloween.
When I had other people test my game, I learned that I needed to make the instructions more detailed and straight-forward. I also made the movement of the panda ghost smoother and not so jittery. Afterwards, I got the idea to add good candy in addition to the evil candy, lives, and a score tracker on the game screen. This helped my game seem a little bit less like League Invaders, which I had worked on prior to Candy Guard.
My game is made up of many different parts and classes which work together to help my game run. The different classes in my game are CandyGuard, GameObject, GamePanel, ObjectManager, Projectile, Ghost, GoodCandy, and BadCandy. The CandyGuard class is what runs the game. It has the JFrame, which controls the size of the screen and starts the game when it runs. The GameObject class controls the size of the collisionBoxes and has the isAlive variable, which checks whether or not the object is alive. The GamePanel class controls the appearance of the game. It includes the images in the game, the fonts, the colors, and the different states. The ObjectManager class controls what the objects do and what to do when they collide with one another. The Projectile class draws the projectile and controls its speed and size. The Ghost class draws the panda ghost and controls its movement and size. The GoodCandy class and BadCandy class do the same thing as the Projectile class.
I faced many challenges while making my game. To overcome these problems, I asked for help from teachers and went to make-up labs to get some extra work done. I am proud of the lives and the good candies. It adds variety and makes the game more interesting. The steps I took to accomplish my goal was to work hard and get as much done as I could while in class.
The most challenging part of the project was facing and overcoming new problems that appeared. I had to adjust many things to make my game fun and look good. I asked for help when I didn't know what to do and played around to see if I could fix the problems myself.
In the future, I would add a timer and maybe make the game speed up after a while to make it more interesting and challenging.
